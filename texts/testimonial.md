Who are Tatyana & Antonina? The Odesa Sisters are a remarkable example of Ukrainian resiliency. Both are English language & literature multiple university degree holders & like many Ukrainians before the full scale invasion on 24/2/2022, had a good life running their family business while also being stock managers of imported products. However, the moment their family, friends & colleagues volunteered to fight for Ukraine’s freedom, the Sisters decided to meet the sudden demand for military uniforms & protective gear, utilizing their professional & academic background. Many of you donated for those uniforms & gear which protected the brave soldiers. Now, medics & wounded soldiers from near the front are calling them daily asking for these adaptive pants to ease even a fraction of the pain the wounded & maimed are enduring. Tatyana talks with the soldiers daily to understand what they need in their recovery.  
The Odesa Sisters produce these pants with zero profit at the moment – in fact, they sometimes use their life savings to meet the unexpected increase in costs because its more urgent to provide these basic amenities to the hospitalized defenders. The price for 1 set of 2 pants is equivalent to the price of 1 sold on Amazon. The Sisters use good quality Turkish fabric to lengthen the life of the pants. 
They deeply appreciate your generosity & willingness to part with your hard earned money for the wounded to help them recover their strength & without exception thank each donor.
Please kindly donate to support Tatyana & Antonina support the wounded – these sisters are real & honest. Your money will make a huge difference.
