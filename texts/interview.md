Odesa Sisters Interview


The following is an interview conducted with @tatyanaodesssa, who is 
currently co-running two fundraisers for the front.

Q: Are you and Antonina really sisters?

Yes ðŸ˜Š@antoninaodessa is 6 years younger than me, but we are biological 
sisters.

â€”â€”â€”

Q. What were you doing before the war?

At the time I was the head of Imports and Exports for Campari in Ukraine. 
I travelled outside of Ukraine frequently and just before the war I had 
been invited to Japan, but the visa took too long so I couldnâ€™t travel ðŸ˜­

Antonina had the idea to start a family business in producing towels, 
bathrobes, bed linens, and other amenities for luxury hotels. She spent a 
lot of time in Turkey learning how to source the raw materials and sew 
them to the higher standards such products required.

We were successful and even had staff in Kyiv and Kharkiv, but since the 
full-scale invasion weâ€™ve lost touch with some of them and arenâ€™t sure if 
they are even alive. 

â€”â€”â€”

Q. It sounds like the war has severely impacted your career. When did you 
start helping the war effort?

Well, actually, when the full scale invasion started, many people around 
me talked about leaving Odesa, leaving Ukraine. But when I thought about 
it, you see, I am from Odesa, I love Odesa, Odesa is my identity. Of 
course, our business stopped (or almost stopped) because we couldn't keep 
our staff - as mentioned earlier, we lost touch with some of them. And 
soon after the full scale invasion started, you know, many of our friends 
started volunteering to become defenders. They needed thingsâ€”basic things 
like uniforms, protective plates, and so onâ€”so, Antonina and I started to 
try to help them. At first, we just to get our hands on things we could 
give to our friends going to fight for us. Of course, the import/export 
business stopped, so things became harder to acquire. Then a few months 
ago we were asked to make ZSU uniforms for Zaporizhzhia and that was our 
first fundraiser. 

The experience that Antonina gained in Turkey and from running our family 
business really helped in that regard. I donâ€™t think we would be as useful 
to the war effort if not for her.

The money donated was used for the material, paying one lady to cut, two 
ladies to sew, and then a little bit for gasoline to procure all the 
material and to send the products to where they needed to go. To be 
honest, Antonina and I used our savings for some of the larger uniforms, 
we need more textiles, and that isn't included in the price. So far, we 
were able to manage as I was able to make some money with a job I had last 
year. But now the requests from the front are increasing.

Q. What are your current fundraising activities?

Well, as you know after our first fundraiser for uniforms, we were asked 
by the doctors, medics, and soldiers for these adaptive underwear for use 
at the hospitals where the injured defenders were being treated. We have 
just dispatched another batch of underwear but we have already received 
very good feedback from the people who received them. We had prepared 
another fundraiser for more when we got the urgent request for uniforms 
from the Zaporizhzhia front.

So, currently we have a second fundraiser for uniforms with high priority.

The government provides uniforms to soldiers, but the soldier has no time 
to wash the uniform in the current counteroffensive. If their uniform is 
ripped or stained, they can't stop fighting and wash and dry and wait to 
change again. So we provide the replacement uniforms so that at minimum, 
the soldiers who have wear and tear or small wounds can go back out with 
proper clothing. 

The economy in Ukraine is hammered every day by Russia. War is expensive 
and the money from the government and aid from foreign countries has to be 
spent on infrastructure and weapons. That makes sense. But we as civilians 
can help in other ways, like providing durable clothing. Obviously 102 
uniforms is not enough, but we try as we know there are limits to how much 
we can do to help.

â€”â€”â€”

Q. How can everyone else help?

You are already helping so much. We are so grateful for all the help, all 
the donations, all the efforts people are making to help Ukraine. We 
really appreciate all the funds donated - I thank everyone even if it is 
only a few dollars, as I, having been in business and being a mother of 
two girls, know how hard it is to make money, and how each donation is 
actually a sacrifice. Anyway, any and all help is really useful. But for 
us right now, first and foremost, we must focus on the request for 
uniforms for the defenders at the front.

â€”â€”â€”

Q. Given your prior career, I have to ask: why are you making these things 
instead of importing them? Wouldnâ€™t it be cheaper? I found Chinese 
adaptive underwear on Amazon for $34 per pair. Army surplus uniforms can 
be imported from the UK for about $15. I recognize it helps the Odesa 
economy not to send the money overseas,  but isnâ€™t this rather expensive?

There is often a reason that army surplus is sold after-market to 
consumers. Sometimes there are defects that make the clothes ok for 
wearing around the house, but not in battle.

It is the same for medical clothing. Maybe itâ€™s ok. Maybe not. But a 
hospital in a safe country will not blindly purchase 1000 pairs of such 
underwear from Wish.com without knowing the quality or trusting the 
vendor. Why would we do such things for field hospitals in a war zone? We 
donâ€™t have time to test the trustworthiness of every account on eBay while 
people are getting shot at.

By the way, there were many complaints about Turkish military shirts 
(Ubaks) at the beginning of the war, not because they were bad, but 
because their sizing chart was different from ours. These things are hard 
to predict and waste time.

I have no idea what kind of uniform from the UK is available for $15. If 
the velcro is falling off or buttons are missing. Maybe itâ€™s made from 
polyester and melts in combat. Thatâ€™s the problem. Itâ€™s like playing the 
lottery with peopleâ€™s lives. 

Overall, we will still carry out this fundraising for the uniforms and the 
fundraising for adaptive clothing ðŸ¤—

I want to thank @tatyanaodesssa for taking the time to answer our 
questions and both she and @antoninaodessa for fact-checking this before 
it went out.
