The Odesa Sisters
Ukraine’s Resilient Women							     2023 July 8
500 days since the full scale illegal invasion by Russia
 
 
An interview with Tatyana Kagitina @tatyanaodesssa, who is currently co-running two fundraisers for the front from Odesa, Ukraine.
Q: First of all, are you and Antonina really sisters?
A: 	Yes! She @antoninaodessa is 6 years younger than me, but we are biological sisters. We are very close in both private life and professional work. 

Q: What were you doing before the war?
A:	 I was the Representative and Head of Imports & Exports for Campari in Ukraine.  I travelled internationally on a frequent basis, as close as Moldova, Romania and Georgia, and as far as Guangzhou in China, while my boss was in the USA.
I also worked with Antonina, who had the idea to start a family business in producing and importing towels, bathrobes, bed linens, and uniform for high-end hotels. She trained in Turkey learning how to source the raw materials and manufacture products to high standards. We were successful and had business partners in Kyiv and Kharkiv. Unfortunately, since February 2022 we’ve lost touch with some of them and aren’t sure if they are even alive. And of course our business almost stopped completely.

Q: Did you think about evacuating after February 2022?
A: 	When the full scale invasion started, many people around me talked about leaving Odesa, leaving Ukraine. I thought about it. However, I love Odesa, which throughout history has been a cosmopolitan international port city with the confluences of cultures and people. I myself am from Odesa, from a family with ancestral roots from Ukraine, Poland and Russia. Odesa, Ukraine is my identity. 
All my memories are in Odesa, how my grandfather was a sailor who brought back gifts from the world over including Japan. Both Antonina and I graduated Odesa National University with English Literature and Language degrees. My younger child is learning Karate now here and even now attends her classes every week. My world is based in Odesa. I stop being me if I leave Odesa and Ukraine. So, I stayed. 

Q: It sounds like the war has severely impacted your career. 
A:	 Well of course, like all Ukrainians in fact. However we need to look forward, thinking of how to rebuild our economy even now, and especially after the war is won.

Q: When did you start helping the war effort?
A:	 Soon after the full scale invasion, many of our friends started volunteering to become defenders. They needed basic things like uniforms, protective plates and so on. Our defenders’ uniforms become damaged and soiled everyday, especially after injuries.  So, Antonina and I started to try to help them. At first, we just got our hands on things we could give to our friends going to fight for us – with all my contacts in international trading that was not difficult. Of course, the import/export business became unpredictable so things became harder to acquire quite quickly. Then, a few months ago we were asked to make ZSU specific uniforms for the defenders at the Zaporizhzhia front, and that was our first cloud funding experience. 
In producing ZSU specific uniforms, the experience that Antonina gained in Turkey and from running our family business truly helped. In fact, I don’t think we would be as useful to the war effort if not for her professional expertise.
The money generously donated was used for the material, paying one lady to cut, two ladies to sew, and then a little bit for gasoline to procure all the material and to send the products to where they need to go. To be honest, Antonina and I used our savings for some of the larger uniforms which need more textiles, and that wasn’t included in the price. So far, we were able to manage but now the requests from the front are increasing so we are aware of the challenges ahead.

Q: What are your current fundraising activities?
A: 	After our first fundraiser for uniforms, we were asked by doctors, medics, and soldiers for these adaptive underwear for use at the hospitals where the injured defenders were being treated. We have just dispatched another batch of underwear but we have already received excellent feedback from the recipients. We had just prepared a second fundraiser for the adaptive underwear when we received the urgent request for 102 ZSU specific uniforms from the Zaporizhzhia front. So, currently we have a second fundraiser for uniforms with high priority.

Q: Why are you making uniforms for the defenders? 
A: 	War is expensive. Ukraine's economy is hammered every day by Russia. The government's money and international assistance must be spent on basic infrastructure and weapons. That makes sense. 
The soldiers have no time to wash or mend their uniforms in the current counteroffensive. When their uniform is ripped, burnt or stained, a fighter can't stop to wash, dry, repair and change. When he is injured, the uniform is also torn apart. So the uniforms being produced and delivered are not extra uniforms, they are to dress the defenders so they can go fight with proper clothing.
Obviously 102 uniforms is not enough, but it is better to provide 102 than not – it is something we as civilians can do.

Q: How can everyone else help?
A:	 First of all, you are already helping Ukraine so much. We are so grateful for all the help from outside of Ukraine as well as from within.  All the donations, all the welcoming of evacuees outside of Ukraine, all the crushing of disinformation. It is amazing. 
We especially appreciate all the funds donated to grass root war efforts like ours.  I thank everyone even if it is only a few dollars. Having been in business and being a mother of two girls, I know how hard it is to make money, and how each donation is actually a sacrifice. Any and all help is really valuable. For us right now, first and foremost, we focus on the request for uniforms for the defenders at the front, and hope that our requests for donations will be heard. 

Q: Given your background and career, why are you producing these products instead of importing them? I found Chinese adaptive underwear on Amazon for $34 per pair. Army surplus uniforms is sold in the UK for about $15. I recognize it helps the Odesa economy not to send the money overseas, but isn’t it cheaper to import?
A: 	Your question is interesting as we have in fact received several anonymous suggestions to buy from army surplus shops or on-line vendors. Some even gave us the exact contact attaching a price list. Honestly, I have not seen nor touched the UK or USA surplus uniforms selling at US$15. Whether the uniforms are used or new, if all the fixtures are in place, if the sizes are correct to dress our defenders, if the material is rip-stop and heat resistant, and of course, there is the camouflage pattern. There is often a good reason why army surplus is sold after-market to general civilian consumers. Sometimes there are defects that make the clothes acceptable for wearing around the house, but not appropriate for battle with live rounds. That’s the problem as we cannot play lottery with our defenders' lives. 
What I wish to say is that, we produce uniforms with specifications defined by the ZSU with durable rip stop / twill material, which costs approximately US$ 13/meter. That price is not expensive when comparing with the international market. The camouflage pattern is specified by ZSU so it is not like one can buy the uniform on-line or in surplus shops in bulk. In the end, we must deliver ZSU specific camouflage uniforms which isn’t available in foreign surplus shops. For those who say, it does not matter that the camouflage is not ZSU specified, I ask them - would they send their own defenders to fight risking their lives with surplus shop uniforms even if they did not comply with their army’s regulations?

It is the same for medical clothing. Maybe products sold on-line is acceptable, but perhaps it is not. A hospital in any safe country will not blindly purchase 1,000 pairs of adaptive underwear on-line without knowing the quality or trusting the vendor. Why would we do such things for field hospitals in a war zone? We don’t have time to test the trustworthiness of every on-line account while people are getting emergency treatment every minute. Also, our underwear price is for two pairs including delivery costs, so it is already 50% cheaper than Amazon.com.

By the way, there were many complaints about Turkish military shirts (Ubaks) at the beginning of the war, not because they were bad quality, but because their sizing chart was different from ours. These are unpredictable and time-wasting complications & also take away the chance to deliver the correct items in time.
 

Q: How do you keep going? 
A:	 This question reminds me of what one of my children asked me in March 2022. She asked me if she would die before her birthday in the summer. My healthy child was asking me if she would be killed by Russians within a few months. 
Everyday, most Ukrainians are more afraid of suffering than to be killed by the Russians. Suffering from being injured when a missile hits ones’ home, suffering from discovering your family or closest friend has been killed, suffering from being told the defender who was provided a uniform has lost a limb, suffering to see the excruciating pain of the soldiers who are being treated from severe wounds from the Russian attacks and being able to only provide some relief with chocolates or adaptive underwear. 
In the past 500 days, we have experienced despair, hope, fear, and pride. I have learnt that there are no borders to values, that help comes unexpectedly, and to believe without logic is the most difficult and magical thing. Life is beautiful and can be short. 
We will carry out this fundraising for the uniforms for our defenders at the Zaporizhzhia front and for adaptive clothing for the injured at the army hospitals near the front. We must and will persist.
We sincerely hope that donations will continue be made to make these actions possible.
And of course, Ukraine will win!
